<p>OWASP DevSlop Pixi Module - A.K.A Patty The Pipeline</p>
<strong>This website is</strong> the <a href="~/Home/Patty.cshtml">Patty</a> Module proof of concept!  Built with an Azure + ASP.Net Core DevSecOps pipeline, it releases
<strong>this website/web app</strong> through the pipeline to demonstrate implemented security automation.  Most of the learning of this module will
be done on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyxbNw11fMUgoR3XpVYVPIQ">YouTube Video Series</a>, where
<a href="https://aka.ms/SheHacksPurpleBlog">Tanya</a> and friends explore various technical solutions in attempts to automate AppSec as much as possible.
    Check out <a href="~/Home/Patty.cshtml">Patty</a>!
     This module is lead by <strong><a href="https://aka.ms/SheHacksPurpleBlog">Tanya Janca</a></strong>.
